# LibMatrix

The objective of this matrix library is to accomplish the following:
1. Provide a way to implement matrix operations in a readable manner (y = A * x * A.inverse() + b)
2. Allow a matrix to be composed of any type defined by the user (even other Matrices)
3. Eventually provide most standard matrix operations depending on the attributes of the Matrix
4. Focus lastly on performance, understanding that readability will impact performance somewhat
